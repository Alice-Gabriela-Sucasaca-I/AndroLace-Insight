Notes
Local mode uses only the content extracted from the paper (abstract and first sections). The response is framed as "only based on the paper."

If any URL in the CSV requires JavaScript to load content or is a PDF, the HTML extractor may not obtain the full text.

Future improvements: PDF extraction, better parsing heuristics, robust integration with the language API.
